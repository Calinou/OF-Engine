    Function: height_brush_handle
    An internal function used for creation of "brush handle",
    that is a "center" of height brush that you define.

    Like, if you define a height brush that is 6 units wide
    and 4 units long, you'll want to specify handle position
    at 2, 1 (indexes start at 0). Specifying i.e. 0, 0 or
    5, 3 will make the handle be at brush corners.

    You pass the position using two arguments to this
    function (which represent x and y).

    See also <height_brush_verts>.
]]

--[[!
    Function: height_brush_verts
    An internal function used for creation of actual brush
    verts. You give it a table in format

    (start code)
        {
            { 1, 1, 1 }
            { 1, 0, 1 }
            { 1, 1, 1 }
        }
    (end)

    This example will set up verts for brush that makes a squared
    border. Setting the 0 to 1 would make actual square. You can
    go up to 8, 8 means biggest height increase and 0 means no
    height increase.

    If you're making just a dot, use a table in format

    (start code)
        { 1 }
    (end)

    Please note that for "line", you'll have to use a standard
    way of defining brush verts, this one works for dots only.

    Function: select_height_brush
    Selects a height brush from <brushes>. It increments
    <height_brush_index> (but makes sure it doesn't overrun
    <max_height_brushes>). By default, it prints the brush
    name into the console, but doesn't have to.

    Parameters:
        num - a number specifying by how many to increment
        the brush index. You'll want 1 usually.
        silent - if this is specified and true, the function
        won't print out the brush name (useful for setting

    Creates a new height brush. It increments <max_height_brushes>

    The function clears current brush, sets up brush handle (see
    <height_brush_handle>) and brush verts (see <height_brush_verts>)
    and returns the brush name.

    Parameters:
        name - the brush name.
        x - handle x position.
        y - handle y position.
        verts - the table as specified in <height_brush_verts>.

        Function: create_cube
        Creates a cube with given parameters. Please note
        that not all positions are sufficient for creating
        cubes, you need to fit into the grid.

        For example, when you have coords 512, 512, 512
        and cube of size 64, it's fine, because it can fit in.

        But if you change the coords to 1, 1, 1, only cube of
        size 1 can fit there.

        The coordinates also have to fit in the world, so
        the positions can range from 0 to <world.get_size>.

        Parameters:
            x - the x position of the cube.
            y - the y position of the cube.
            z - the z position of the cube.
