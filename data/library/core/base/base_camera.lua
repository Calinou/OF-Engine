    Function: force
    Forces camera components to fixed values.

    Parameters:
        x - The X coord to force.
        y - The Y coord to force.
        z - The Z coord to force.
        yaw - The yaw to force.
        pitch - The pitch to force.
        roll - The roll to force.
        fov - The fov to force.

    Function: force_position
    Forces camera position.

    Parameters:
        x - X position.

    Function: reset
    Resets the camera. This cancels all forced
    values and goes back to fully dynamic camera.
]]

    Function: get
    Gets camera information.

    Returns:
        Table with camera information.

    Table contents:

--[[!
    Functions: center_on_entity
    Centers view on selected entity. Increment
    through selection by N. For example, N == 1
    means next, N == -1 means previous.

    You can set distance from the entity via
    engine variable called entautoviewdist.

    Parameters:
        N - the increment factor.
