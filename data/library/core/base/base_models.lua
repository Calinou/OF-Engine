    Class: md5
    This table contains every function related somehow to MD5 (id tech 4)
    model format. <iqm> and <smd> have equivalent functions. Please note
    that these functions are meant to be called only from md5.lua script
    for a model.

    Text taken from Sauerbraten model reference:
        MD5 models require a proper configuration to function; make sure your
        exporter properly exports mesh names in the MD5 file so that these can
        be referenced in the configuration file (the Blender exporter does not
        export these, but a fixed Blender MD5 exporter can be gotten from the
        Cube wiki, <http://cube.wikispaces.com/Blender+to+MD5+to+Sauerbraten>).

        Make sure no more than 4 blend weights are used per vertex, any extra
        blend weights will be dropped silently. The skeleton should use no more
        than 256 bones, and less than 70 or so bones should be used if you wish
        the model to be skeletally animated on the GPU. To optimize animation
        of the model on both CPU and GPU, keep the number of blend weights per
        vertex to a minimum. Also, similar combinations of blend weights are
        cached while animating, especially on the CPU, such that if two or
        more vertices use the same blend weights, blending calculations only
        have to be done once for all the vertices - so try and minimize the
        number of distinct combinations of blend weights if possible.

        When animating skeletal models, you should model the animations as a
        single piece for the entire body. In the configuration file, you can
        choose a bone at which to split the model into an upper and lower part
        (via <animation_part>), which allows, for example, the upper body
        movement of one animation to be combined with the lower body movement
        of another animation automatically. The bone at which you split the
        animation up should ideally be a root bone, of which the upper body
        and lower body are separate sub-trees. Rigging the model in this way
        also allows for pitch animation (which also requires selecting a bone
        to pitch at) to take place such as bending at the waist, which
        similarly requires the upper body to be a sub-tree of the bone at
        which the pitch animation will occur.

        The included MD5 support allows for two methods of attaching models to
        another: via tags (by assigning a tag name to a bone with <tag>), or
        by animating multiple models against a common, named skeleton that
        will be shared among all of them (useful for modeling clothing
        attachments and similar items). To use a shared skeleton, you simply
        export all the models with the same skeleton. Animations only need to
        be specified for the base model. A name for the skeleton is specified
        via the <load> command, for both the model exporting the skeleton and
        the models using it. When one of the models is attached to the one
        supplying the skeleton internally, the tag setup is instead ignored
        and the skeleton/animations of the base model are used to animate the
        attachment as if it were a sub-mesh of the base model itself.

            filename - md5 animation filename.
            fps - optional argument specifying frames per second at
            which to run the animation. If none is specified or is
            0, 10 FPS is the default.
            priority - optional argument specifying a priority for
            the animation (defaults to 0).
            start - an optional start frame offset within the animation,
            where a positive values is an offset from the first frame,
            and a negative value is an offset from end.
            end - an optional animation length in frames, where positive
            values specify the length, or negative values merely subtract
