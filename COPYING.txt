OctaForge is based on Syntensity, Syntensity contributors were:

  * Alon 'kripken' Zakai - kripken@syntensity.com
  * quaker66 - quaker66@gmail.com

The codebase also contains code originating from Cube 2/Sauerbraten, see
their license under src/readme_sauerbraten.txt.

OctaForge uses the Tesseract rendering engine by Lee 'eihrul' Salzman,
see src/readme_tesseract.txt.

Additionally, some code is taken from (or is inspired by) the Lamiae
RPG engine by Kevin 'Hirato Kirata' Meyer, mostly in the UI part (zlib
licensed).

Special thanks to Lee "eihrul" Salzman for the help with the Cube 2/Tesseract
codebase and moral support.
