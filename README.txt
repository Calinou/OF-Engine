OctaForge
================

This is OctaForge developer beta (0.2.8, September 16 2013)

In sync with Tesseract.

For installation, read INSTALL.
To run it, launch bin_unix/client_YOUROS_YOURARCH on *nix
and bin_winYOURARCH\client_win_YOURARCH.exe on Windows from
either the main directory or the bin directory.

There is "empty" map bundled with the engine.
It uses drawing application example by default.
Draw a line with LMB, stop it with RMB, change color
with MMB.

There are other example scripts too.
To use them, simply modify map.lua of "empty" map.

In case of problems, delete contents of your OF home
directory ($HOME/.octaforge_client on *nix,
My Documents\My Games\OctaForge on Windows)

If the problem persists, report it into our
issue tracker - https://github.com/OctaForge/OF-Engine/issues
