OctaForge
================

This is OctaForge developer alpha 10 (0.1.9, 27 December 2011)

In sync with Tesseract: 26b50e8f (flag icon fix)

For installation, read INSTALL.
To run it, launch bin_unix/client_YOUROS_YOURARCH on *nix
and bin_winYOURARCH\client_win_YOURARCH.exe on Windows.
You need to run them from the primary OF directory, not
from the directory containing the binary.

There is "empty" map bundled with the engine.
It uses drawing application example by default.
Draw a line with LMB, stop it with RMB, change color
with MMB.

There are other example scripts too.
To use them, simply modify map.lua of "empty" map.

In case of problems, delete contents of your OF home
directory ($HOME/.octaforge_client on *nix,
My Documents\My Games\OctaForge on Windows)

If the problem persists, report it into our
issue tracker - https://github.com/OctaForge/OF-Engine/issues
