This is a Kate mode for OctaScript.

It will also work for Qt Creator, KDevelop and other editors that use
the same editor component.

Install to $HOME/.kde4/share/apps/katepart/syntax.

This will work with Kate and KDevelop by default but might not work with
Qt Creator by default. For Qt Creator, you will have to either manually
select the path to the "syntax" directory or copy it to Qt Creator's own
directory.
